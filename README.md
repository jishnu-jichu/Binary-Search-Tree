# Binary-Search-Tree

Binary Tree is a tree data structure where each node has atmost 2 children named left and right.
When it comes to Binary Search Tree(BST),it's a binary tree with 2 properties
  (i) The left subtree has a value that is less than the value in parent node.
  (ii) The right subtree has a value that is greater than or equal to the value in the parent node
  
        The below uploaded code is a simple java program to implement a binary search tree.
       On executing this code, we will be able to insert nodes into the binary tree according to the main 2 properties 
       mentioned above. And we are also able to do 3 traversals.They are
       (i) Inorder Traversal
								- Traverse the left subtree
								- Visit the root
								- Travers the right subtree
       (ii) Preorder Traversal
			 					- Visit the root
								- Traverse the left subtree
								- Traverse the right subtree
       (iii) Postorder Traversal
			 					- Traverse the left subtree
								- Traverse the right subtree
								-Visit the root
			
			
We can also search for a particular key in the binary search tree.
